# dita-custom-ant-parser
DITA Open Toolkit plugin which can apply in the pre-process stage a custom ANT build file over the original topic contents.
As an example the plugin is configured to dynamically change ASCIIDOC and reStructureText files to DITA. 

Installation steps:

1. Install the **com.oxygenxml.ant.parser.dita** plugin in the DITA Open Toolkit: https://www.dita-ot.org/dev/topics/plugins-installing.html
2. The ASCIIDOC installation needs to be downloaded from: https://asciidoc-py.github.io/INSTALL.html
3. The reStructureText installation needs to be downloaded from: http://sourceforge.net/p/docutils/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/docutils/ 
Click the "Download snapshot" button. The publishing was tested using Python 3.8 with the docutils module installed from: https://pypi.org/project/docutils/#files
4. Install also a Python interpreter version 2.x on your local computer.
5. The build file **com.oxygenxml.ant.parser.dita/resources/build.xml** needs to be edited and the path "asciidoc.install.dir" needs to be set to the place. Also the "restructure.install.dir" parameter can point to the reStructureText installation folder if you also want to dynamically convert reStructureText content to DITA.
6. A sample DITA Map can be found in the **samples** folder.
